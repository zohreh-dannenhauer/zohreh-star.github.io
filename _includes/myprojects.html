                  <span class="project-tagline">My work focused on integrating Perception, Planning and Interpretation to help an agent to respond to unexpected changes in dynamic world. We claim that an intelligent agent should actively watch for what can go wrong and
anticipate mistakes before they occur. Some world changes affect the agent’s goals and some affect
the agent’s plan. The agent should be able to respond to these changes appropriately to successfully
accomplish its tasks.
